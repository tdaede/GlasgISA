# GlasgISA

GlasgISA is an interface board that connects an ISA bus to a LPC bus. The LPC bus can be connected to a Glasgow applet or a modern motherboard with TPM header.

To interface with an ISA card, the GlasgISA must be plugged into an ISA backplane. Alternatively, it can be plugged into an ISA motherboard and act as a device.
